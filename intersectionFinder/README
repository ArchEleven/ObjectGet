intersection Finder uses OpenStreetMap data too find the GPS coordinates and names of all the intersections within a certain area. For more information on how OpenStreetMap works and how their data is stored, checked out http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page

Instructions for use:
1. Go to http://www.openstreetmap.org/export and find the area which you want too extract the intersections from. I recommend getting the intersections for a few blocks outside your play area on every side, just in case the players wander outside too far. Usually "Manually select a different area" too get the exact area you want and then hit export.

2. The downloaded file will be called "map.osm." Rename it "map.xml" and put it in the data folder. The folder current contains an example file - go ahead and delete that.

3. Launch the application in processing and run it.
